1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Smartphone that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.

public class Smartphone extend Technology{

 int.number;
 String.name;

public Smartphone(String name, int number){
super(name, number);
this.number=number;
this.name=name;
}

public name getName(){return this.name;}
public in getNumber(){return this.number;}

b)  Explain what INHERITANCE is.
    Inheritance is a mathod to connect to object or class 

c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".  
   public void speak(){
   system .out.println{"my name is"+this.getname()+ this.number());
   
d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
            keyword super
